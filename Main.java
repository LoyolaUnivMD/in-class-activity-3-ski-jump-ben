//Lab Assignment: In class activity 3 - ski jump
//Problem Statement: calculate the points earned based on how far you jump off ski ramp
//Data In: type of hill and speed going
//Data Out: points
//Credits: none

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        //Given the type of ski jump (normal vs. large) and the jumperâ€™s speed at the end of the ramp, predict how far they will jump using the simplification in the table below. Then output their number of points earned.

        //Calculate the points earned as 60 + (distance - par)*points_per_meter.
        double pointsEarned = 60 + (distanceTraveled - par)*pointsPerMeter;

        //logic
